Kindly make all the commits over here. Whatever changes you make in the code, do not share the code through any other network.
Also do not download the "zip" of it. Rather clone so that we all can do a collaborative work.

It would be better if you fork it first and then make changes in your own forked repository. 
Do not change in MASTER branch. Simple fork it and then apply your changes.
